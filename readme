Required Packages
=================

Python 2.0 or later
    http://www.python.org
PyGame 1.2 or later
    http://www.pygame.org



Execution Requirements
======================

Right now, you'll have to do this on your own, I'll eventually right a script for it.
Copy the files recursively to where ever you would like.  And make a link to the c4.py file.
make sure the c4.py file has the correct executable in the first line, it should look like
#!/usr/bin/env PYTHONEXECUTABLE
where the PYTHONEXECUTABLE is a version of python 2.0 or later and that version of Python MUST
have PyGame installed.



How-To
======

If the variable on line 1 of c4.py is the correct executable for Python, simply type ./c4.py
to execute.  Other-wise type Python (if this is version 2.0 or later) and then c4.py.  E.G.
Python2 c4.py
You may also define your own image and/or audio directory.  Where atleast 1 image directory is
required an audio directory is not required to run the program.  To set the audio directory to
one of you liking, you can type the following
./c4.py -audio myAudioSubDir
or
python2 c4.py -audio myAudioSubDir
and the game will then use the audio files in the directory you provided.  Same thing can be
done for all of the images in the game, just instead of -audio, type -images and specify your
image directory.
!!NOTICE!! IF YOU SPECIFY A DIRECTORY FOR EITHER/BOTH IMAGE/AUDIO YOU WILL NEED TO HAVE ALL OF
THE FILES NAMED AS THE ORIGINAL FILE NAMES IN THAT DIRECTORY, ALL MUST EXIST!  BUT IF YOU
SPECIFY AN AUDIO DIRECTORY THAT DOES NOT EXIST, AUDIO WILL SIMPLY BE DISABLED.
If you want you can have blank short waves with names of sounds you don't care to hear, just make
sure you have the required sound filess.

If you want a complete listing of all images/audio needed, you'll find it in AUDIOFILES and
IMAGEFILES.

Also at the command line you can type either help/info for help on the commands available, or info
about the game/author.



How-To Game-Play
================

At the start, 2 players are required to enter their names.  The first to enter his/her name in will
be player one, which uses the Black piece in the game.  2nd player uses red.  Black always starts
the game off.  Once in game play, each player is required to pick up a piece, as the turn happens.
To pick up a piece you must either hit the space key, ot right click with the mouse.  Then to place
the picked up piece, you use the left mouse button, dropping it into the column you chose.  Simply
move the mouse over the column where you'd like to have your piece dropped, then left click there.
The goal is to get 4 pieces of your color in a row, at any angle.  Once you win/lose, you are given
the option of starting a new game, or quiting.  If you are to continue, your score is tallied up, and
a new game begins.  At any time during the game you may hit escape to chose to quit.
